# Reticular Activating System
In you is a quiet guardian called the reticular activating system (RAS). This is an automatic brain process that draws your attention to things in the world around you that it thinks you should pay attention to. 

## Why it's a tool for you
With a change of focus, your RAS will change the things it highlights. Solutions and opportunities will appear out of nowhere.

## Your RAS is always working
Here's an example: You buy a new car of a certain model. Then, you start to notice that car everywhere you go! This is because your RAS is always at work, filtering the information you take in. You may not have noticed so many drivers of that specific type of car before. Funny, isn't it?

*Thinking: Perhaps this is similar to the typical mechanic in videogames where important quest items are highlighted?*

## Your RAS doesn't understand why it's important, only that it is important

### Example 1: Foraging for food

What you tell your RAS:
- "I want to feed my family, so I will forage for food."

What happens as a result of your RAS working:
- Edible plants and berries will appear more easily to you. (There is an infinite amount of data to process, so your RAS will highlight the most relevant information.)
- Your RAS will also highlights things like snakes and harmful plants. (Assuming you treat living as an "important" thing, your RAS will highlight threats.)

### Example 2: RAS highlights "threats". Tunnel vision.

What you tell your RAS: 
- "My performance is down, so I need to avoid making mistakes."

What happens as a result of your RAS working:
- You will interpret certain comments and behaviors from others as negative, and begin to feel anxious. (Your RAS is simply being sensitive to threats. And so it will highlight threats more than anything else.)

## How to wield your RAS effectively
Focus on what you want. (Your RAS will highlight solutions and opportunities.)

Pay attention to what you treat as important. (Your RAS will highlight threats.)

Your insecurities will cause your RAS to highlight the things you fear. You will be extra sensitive to these things and act improperly.

Desperation, neediness, and other negative emotions will cause your RAS to highlight threats, giving you more cause to act in ways that push people away. 

Aim for the goal. Do not aim for what you want to avoid.
